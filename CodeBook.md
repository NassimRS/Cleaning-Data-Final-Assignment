Variable Selection for the Database
=================

The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

R Script 
=================

A R script called run_analysis was created which performs the following actions on the dataset described above:

1- The data was first uploaded and the training and test sets was merged to create one data set stored in df_merged
2- The merged data was labeled based on features (Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names) stored in df_features and added to df_merged
3- Then only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement was extracted and stored in df_mergedMeanStd
4- Activity labels was read for train and test data and was added to the merged data 
5- Subject labels for train and test data was read and added to the merged data
6- A descriptive activity names were replaced the numbers correspondent to each activity in the data set
7- A second, independent tidy data set was created with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. This data set was 
called df_new and was stored in NewDataSet.txt file
8-End
